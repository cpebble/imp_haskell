# The simple imperative language
This is an implementation of the simple imperative language IMP, as described in
the book "Formal Semantics of Programming Languages".

It features two parsers, one following the grammar directly, and one with text replaced
with corresponding fun emojis.

It was mostly used to practice haskell, out of boredom.
Expect few to no comments, but a simple monadic interpreter of about 100 lines.

Works on a simple Fibonacci test, but i haven't implemented variable parsing from
source. Thus, the main application has a fixed store.

Could this be better yes. I'm bored, go bother someone else...
